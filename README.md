# MLflow Basics and Usage Guide

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to effectively use **MLflow** for tracking experiments, logging parameters, metrics, and models. The ultimate goal is to provide a concise and practical understanding of MLflow's capabilities and its integration into a production environment. The notebook illustrates the following key components:

- **Logging Parameters (`log_param`)**: Capturing and saving hyperparameters for reproducibility.
- **Logging Metrics (`log_metric`)**: Tracking performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Model Signature Inference (`infer_signature`)**: Defining input-output relationships for models to streamline deployment into production environments.

## Key Features
1. **Experiment Tracking**: Organize and compare multiple experiment runs.
2. **Parameter Logging**: Record hyperparameters for transparency and reproducibility.
3. **Metric Tracking**: Analyze model performance metrics across different runs.
4. **Model Registration**: Facilitate deployment pipelines with well-documented signatures.

## Files in this Repository
- `BASIC_mlflow.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook showcasing the MLflow workflow with detailed step-by-step guidance.
- `.gitignore`: Ignoring unnecessary files such as logs, checkpoints, and virtual environments.

## How MLflow Works
1. **Tracking Server**: MLflow provides a central tracking server to record and query experiments.
2. **Logging Parameters and Metrics**:
   - Use `mlflow.log_param("param_name", value)` to log hyperparameters.
   - Use `mlflow.log_metric("metric_name", value)` to track model performance metrics over time.
3. **Model Signature and Input Examples**:
   - `infer_signature` automatically generates model input and output schemas.
   - Log models with clearly defined signatures for consistent deployment.
4. **Visualization**: Access the MLflow UI to visualize experiment results and compare runs.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mlflow-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook BASIC_mlflow.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Log parameters, metrics, and models.
   - Infer and save model signatures.
   - Use the MLflow UI to analyze results.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how MLflow simplifies the process of tracking experiments and managing machine learning models. By leveraging MLflow's ability to log parameters and metrics, infer signatures, and organize experiments, data scientists and ML engineers can:

- Ensure reproducibility and transparency in their workflows.
- Seamlessly transition models from development to production.
- Enable collaboration and efficient deployment in real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore and modify the code in the notebook to suit your use case. With MLflow, you'll have a robust foundation for managing your machine learning lifecycle.
